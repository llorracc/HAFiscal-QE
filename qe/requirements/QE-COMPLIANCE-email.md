Dear Håkon:  
  
I am pleased to inform you that I have decided to "conditionally accept"  
your submission, MS 2442, entitled  
  
"Welfare and Spending Effects of Consumption Stimulus Policies"  
  
for publication in Quantitative Economics.  
  
For those papers with replication files, you will be expected to submit your replication package to the Data Editor and team for a thorough review ahead of final acceptance.  
  
Please follow these steps:  
  
1.      Go to Data Editor website and review the policy and requirements [https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/es-data-editor-website/data-and-code-availability-policy](https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/es-data-editor-website/data-and-code-availability-policy)  
2.      Follow the steps [https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/es-data-editor-website/package](https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/es-data-editor-website/package)  
3.      Complete the required check list  [https://www.econometricsociety.org/uploads/reports/ES\_Data\_Editor\_Website/Checklist.pdf](https://www.econometricsociety.org/uploads/reports/ES_Data_Editor_Website/Checklist.pdf)  
4.      Submit to Data Editor Editorial Express as a "new submission" for the Data Editor review [https://editorialexpress.com/ESData](https://editorialexpress.com/ESData)  
(resubmission option at DE editorial express site will be for revisions during the replication check process)  
  
  
You should submit the following items to the Data Editor as separate files:  
\*replication files for review (if too large to upload you may email [dataeditor@econometricsociety.org](mailto:dataeditor@econometricsociety.org) for instructions) \*cover letter to Data Editor outlining any exemptions or special instructions \*Data Editor check list \*final manuscript \*any approved online appendices \*cover letter to me if there were last minor revisions  
  
Please submit data files to the data editor within a month of decision.  
If you need an extension, please contact the Director of Publications at [qe@econometricsociety.org](mailto:qe@econometricsociety.org)  
  
Once accepted by the Data Editor, all the final materials will be transferred back to me for my approval and acceptance.  If you have submitted your final revision to the Data Editor, there is no need to submit to the journal again.  
  
  
  
Final revisions WITHOUT any replication files may be submitted at our Society webpage [https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/quantitative-economics/submissions](https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/quantitative-economics/submissions)   It's important to note, an offer to revise a paper is normally valid for 12 months after a decision is issued.  Extensions can be granted to authors at the discretion of the handling editor but must be requested within the 12 months.  
  
Please review the journal's style and formatting policies [https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/quantitative-economics/submissions](https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/quantitative-economics/submissions)  
  
We are no longer typesetting supplemental appendices.  Please make sure that supplements are standalone in both production files and PDFs. We ask that you put your supplement into the journal style found here: [https://www.e-publications.org/es/support/](https://www.e-publications.org/es/support/)  Supplements should be referenced and cited in the main text, instead of previously circulated.  
  
Any questions or concerns, please contact the Director of Publications at [qe@econometricsociety.org](mailto:qe@econometricsociety.org) .  
  
  
Thank you very much for your contribution to Quantitative Economics.  
  
I look forward to seeing your final revision and without too much more delay, seeing your article appear in a future issue of QE.  
  
Sincerely  
  
Morten Ravn
