		  straitened circumstances due to an unemployment spell cut
		  back on expenditures and how they spend marginal dollars of
		  unemployment insurance (UI) benefit. Our theoretical and
		  empirical analyses emphasize the importance of allowing for
		  the fact that households buy durable as well as non-durable
		  goods. The theoretical analysis shows that in the short run
		  households can cut back significantly on total expenditures
		  without a significant fall in welfare if they concentrate
		  their budget reductions on durables. We then present an
		  empirical analysis based on a Canadian survey of workers
		  who experienced a job separation. Exploiting changes in the
		  unemployment insurance system over our sample period we
		  show that cuts in UI benefits lead to reductions in total
		  expenditure with a stronger impact on clothing than on food
		  expenditures. Our empirical strategy allows that these
		  expenditures may be non-separable from employment status.
		  The effects we find are particularly strong for households
		  with no liquid assets before the spell started. These
		  qualitative findings are in precise agreement with the
		  theoretical predictions. (JEL: D11, D12, D91, J65)},

  abstract	= {The goal of this chapter is to study how, and by how much,
		  household income, wealth, and preference heterogeneity
		  amplify and propagate a macroeconomic shock. We focus on
		  the US Great Recession of 2007–09 and proceed in two
		  steps. First, using data from the Panel Study of Income
		  Dynamics, we document the patterns of household income,
		  consumption, and wealth inequality before and during the
		  Great Recession. We then investigate how households in
		  different segments of the wealth distribution were affected
		  by income declines, and how they changed their expenditures
		  differentially during the aggregate downturn. Motivated by
		  this evidence, we study several variants of a standard
		  heterogeneous household model with aggregate shocks and an
		  endogenous cross-sectional wealth distribution. Our key
		  finding is that wealth inequality can significantly amplify
		  the impact of an aggregate shock, and it does so if the
		  distribution features a sufficiently large fraction of
		  households with very little net worth that sharply increase
		  their saving (ie, they are not hand-to mouth) as the
		  recession hits. We document that both these features are
		  observed in the PSID. We also investigate the role that
		  social insurance policies, such as unemployment insurance,
		  play in shaping the cross-sectional income and wealth
		  distribution, and through it, the dynamics of business
		  cycles.},

  abstract	= {We use sizable lottery prizes in Norwegian administrative
		  panel data to explore how transitory income shocks are
		  spent and saved over time and how households' marginal
		  propensities to consume (MPCs) vary with household
		  characteristics and shock size. We find that spending peaks
		  in the year of winning and gradually reverts to normal
		  within five years. Controlling for all items on households'
		  balance sheets and characteristics such as education and
		  income, it is the amount won, age, and liquid assets that
		  vary systematically with MPCs. Low-liquidity winners of the
		  smallest prizes (around US\$1,500) are estimated to spend
		  all within the year of winning. The corresponding estimate
		  for high-liquidity winners of large prizes
		  (US\$8,300–150,000) is slightly below one-half. While
		  conventional models will struggle to account for such high
		  MPC levels, we show that a two-asset life cycle model with
		  a realistic earnings profile and a luxury bequest motive
		  can account for both the time profile of consumption
		  responses and their systematic covariation with
		  observables.},

		  reflecting Scandinavian wage formation institutions. Wages
		  are subject to a downward nominal wage rigidity (DNWR).
		  Inspired by many countries' fiscal policy responses to the
		  Great Recession and the coronavirus pandemic, we
		  investigate the model's ability to generate state-dependent
		  fiscal multipliers. We find, that both the zero lower bound
		  on nominal interest rates and DNWR individually can account
		  for higher fiscal multipliers during recessions. In joint
		  presence, however, the existence of DNWR reduces the
		  multiplier at the ZLB. Moreover, the DNWR significantly
		  relaxes the paradox of toil at the ZLB. We show that the
		  state-dependency is robust to alternative assumptions about
		  the origin of the recession, the nature of the fiscal
		  stimulus and its financing source.},
