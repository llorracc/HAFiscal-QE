# Data

No data were harmed in the making of this paper.

We deliberately used standard data and standard results from the analysis of data from other papers, so that no suspicion could accrue that we tortured the data to make it confess to anything.

There are a few calculations, documented in the Code/ directory, which reproduce calculations made in other work (most notably, calculations about the distribution of liquid assets from the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances; indeed, the precise reason we did not use a newer survey was so that our results would be directly comparable to those obtained in a long literature that has chosen the 2004 SCF as a benchmark).  The 2004 SCF has remained a standard simply because results obtained from later surveys on the relevant questions have been quite similar.
