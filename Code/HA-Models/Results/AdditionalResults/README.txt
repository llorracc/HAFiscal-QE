This folder contains some additional results for different parameterizations of the model. 

The coefficient of relative risk aversion, CRRA, is changed to 1 or 3. 
The net interest rate, R-1, is changed to 0.5 or 1.5 percent. 
An alternative unemployment system is specified with less generous benefits. 

The main results of the paper were not changed by any of these robustness exercises, so they were not included in the paper.
