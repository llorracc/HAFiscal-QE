#%% This script is a reduced version of do_all.py
# It only executes half of Step 4 and Step 5 of do_all.py 
# It thus skips the estimation of the splurge and discount factors (and robustness estimations)
# For step 4, we take the Jacobians computed by HA-Fiscal-HANK-SAM.py as given
# and only conduct the policy experiements. Execution only takes seconds.
# The whole code should take roughly one hour to execute (using a laptop computer)
# For step 5, we consider a simpler setup and reduce the number of discount factors per education group to 1
# Furthermore, we only run N=100 rather than 10000 agents.
# Finally, the Aggregate Demand solution is run calculated with fewer iterations (reducing accuracy)
# The code creates IRF for the simulations in FromPandemicCode\Figures\Reduced_Run
# and a table of the Multipliers in  FromPandemicCode\Tables\Reduced_Run
