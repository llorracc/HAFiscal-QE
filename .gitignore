# NOTE: PDFs are tracked on both branches initially
# They will be deleted from main branch in Step 3 (delete_precomputed_artifacts_from_main)
# The with-precomputed-artifacts branch will keep all PDFs
# After Step 3, main branch will have no PDFs (except README.pdf if needed)

# NOTE: Precomputed artifacts (*.obj, *.csv, *.dta, *.bib) are NOT gitignored
# They will be tracked on both branches initially, then deleted from main only
# This ensures they're present on with-precomputed-artifacts branch
# 
# QE requirement: Main branch should NOT have .bib (only .bbl)
# But .bib is needed on wpa branch for compilation
